# mb-eq_loader

This script loads REW generated EQ into a Parametric EQ object in a BSS Audio
Soundweb London device using the third-party control protocol documented in the
Soundweb London help.  This is not supported by or associated with Harman or
BSS Audio.

So far this can only set a few values directly.  No support has been
implemented for reading from or subscribing to devices.
